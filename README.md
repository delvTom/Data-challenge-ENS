## 🎯 Project Overview

This project was carried out as part of the **Data Challenge 2025**.  
The goal was to **predict the concentration of 23 gases simultaneously** using multivariate sensor measurements.  

A major challenge was the **data distribution shift** between the training and test sets — mainly due to the *Humidity* variable — as the test data represented physical conditions rarely observed in training.  
The evaluation metric was a **Weighted RMSE**, which penalized larger errors more strongly for higher concentration values.

## 🧠 Summary of the Approach

The final solution is based on an **ensemble of Extra Trees Regressors**, combined through a **weighted blending** strategy, followed by **linear calibration** and **shrinkage toward the training mean**.  
Row-wise statistical features (mean, std, IQR, MAD, etc.) played a key role in improving robustness under distribution shift.
